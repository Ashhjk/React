__________HyperText Markup Language___________
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure and layout of a web page by using elements represented by tags.
Key Features of HTML:

    Structure Content: HTML organizes text, images, and other content into elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and multimedia.

    Tag-based Syntax:
        Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <p> for a paragraph.
        Most tags have an opening and closing pair, e.g., <h1>Title</h1>. Some are self-closing, e.g., <img />.

    Hyperlinks: The "HyperText" part refers to the ability to link documents through anchors using the <a> tag.

    Embedding Media: HTML can include images, videos, and other multimedia elements using tags like <img>, <video>, and <audio>.

    Forms and Interactivity: HTML supports user inputs through forms using elements like <input>, <form>, and <button>.

    Semantic Elements: Modern HTML includes semantic tags (e.g., <header>, <article>, <footer>) that help define the purpose of the content.
