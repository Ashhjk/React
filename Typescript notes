Type script is the superset of javascript.

__________________Difference between Typescript and Java Script_____________________
In js when we assign a value to variable by looking on the value itself the  datatype is determined.  eg:name="Ashly"
In typescript we have to explicitly specify the datatype name :string="Ashly"
